-- Performance Analysis
-- To analyze this query, you would run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE [QUERY]` in PostgreSQL.
-- Potential Inefficiencies without Indexes:
--   - Sequential Scans: The database would have to read every single row from all four tables ('bookings', 'profile', 'properties', 'payments') to find the matching records for the JOINs. This is very slow, especially on large tables.
--   - High Join Cost: The database would perform costly join operations (like Nested Loop or Hash Joins) on the full, un-indexed tables, leading to high CPU and memory usage.
--   - The query plan would show high 'cost' and 'time' estimates for each operation.
-- Refactored Query for Improved Performance
-- The structure of the query is correct for the data it needs to retrieve. The performance improvement
-- doesn't come from changing the query itself, but from ensuring the database can execute it efficiently
-- using the indexes we created in 'database_index.sql'.
-- This "refactored" approach relies on the presence of those indexes.
-- When the indexes `idx_bookings_user_id`, `idx_bookings_property_id`, and an index on `payments(booking_id)` exist,
